<h1>Hey! I'm Andrea.</h1>
<p>I'm an Atlanta-based (soon to be New York-based!) software engineer and amateur writer. </p>
<p>I’ve been a fullstack engineer in a Rails and React stack for a little over five years. 
  My favorite type of work is impactful projects that combine thoughtful design with development. 
  I’m interested in exploring empathetic user experiences and the intersection of technology and sustainability.</p> 

<p>In addition to writing about technology, I hope to use this little corner of the internet to explore the balance of motherhood and modern life, and walking in faith and hope in an increasingly hopeless landscape.</p>
<p>When I'm not thinking about software or writing, I'm chasing after my toddler, Noah, and spending time with my husband.</p>
