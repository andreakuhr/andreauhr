1. Day Date!

Big guy on a date vibes

Michael and I both had the day off of work and got to enjoy some fancy coffee drinks and thrifting without wrangling an 18 month old. It was lovely!

2. Feasting at Home’s eggplant chickpea tagine. No pics, ate too fast for the camera. I’m a huge fan of Sylvia, and her blog has basically taught me how to cook—everything from sourdough to braised meats and dressings and curry— over the last four years. She’s a former catering chef and so her recipes include a lot about proper technique. This eggplant tagine was amazing! I would recommend roasting the eggplant in the oven (or air frying if ya got one) rather than frying it on the stove in batches like I did. It’s such a pain!

3. This podcast episode from The Diary of a CEO. Michael actually found this on YouTube, but the Spotify version also has video too apparently for those who can’t suffer YT like me. This episode was about healthy aging, but less like “how to keep wrinkles from happening” and more like “how to live so that you can lift your grandchildren overhead at 80”. It was about life and death, and made me unexpectedly burst into tears while I was out running. Aging is a gift!

4. Trail run

Spooky mill on the trail

So I think I have a new sport! I went on my first trail run this week. There’s a group at my gym that’s running a trail race at Fort Yargo in December. I gave it a whirl to see if this is something I would like and I surprisingly really enjoyed it. I wouldn’t consider myself a long distance runner (at all) but it was a 10/10 better experience than running in the city. 9 mile trail race here I come?

5. Noah’s chicken sweatshirt

I can’t
